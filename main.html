<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>The reason why this motivation can produce great things is because you’re a real user. It’s not just a list of requirements, wireframes, or some product narrative you’re told. As the actual user, you can innovate quickly on the fly. You can test the main use cases and imagine all the corner cases as well. Miscommunication is not involved, poor design documents aren’t a factor, and you have real user empathy for the product you’re making.</p>
